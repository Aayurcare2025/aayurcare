            on financial inclusion and healthcare accessibility, Aayur Care

            Our disbursement framework is meticulously designed to operate as
            both a comprehensive standalone healthcare financing solution and a
            value-enhancing complement to existing insurance
            arrangementsâ€”expanding the scope of accessible care, increasing
            operational flexibility, and reinforcing financial security,
            particularly in areas where conventional insurance structures may
            present practical or procedural constraints.
